# Starting a new Rails Project

* Sometimes I forget how to update things

brew update
brew doctor # optional
brew upgrade

brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
# ruby build has latest versions of ruby

# rbenv install -l to check the latest version available
# make sure it's the same as https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
rbenv install 2.5.0

gem install bundler
gem install rails
